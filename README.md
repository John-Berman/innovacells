JavaScript library for creating spreadsheet like HTML tables.
Provides a sub-set of spreadsheet functionality in html using JavaSript and JSON.

Currently a work in progress. Check back again very soon.

Many solutions currenlty exist for providing this functionality. Most are either overly complex and expensive. I'm looking to create the sweet spot in the middle.
